# CMB 523: Programming for Life Sciences


## Contents
This repository holds my work for the Spring 2024 edition of Prof. Fisk's CMB 523 course.

This repository currently has one folder:
1. CMB_523_Assignments

### CMB_523_Assignments
This folder contains my weekly take home assignments. Alternatively, I *could* make a different repository for each assignment. I should remember to write a new readme for each assignment I upload in either case.
